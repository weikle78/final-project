# final-project

The purpose of my site is to help facilitate wedding packages for people wanting to get married in Oahu, Hawaii. The topic of my pages are home page, beach weddings, sunset weddings, catering, receptions, and photography. Some of the features include a youtube video, table, pictures, implementing a p5.js file in game format, and a fill form. I wanted to keep the design simple, clean, and neat. My colors are very bright and I tried to contrast dark on light in most situations. I had problems with getting some of the pictures I wanted to fit and problems with some of the pictures not shrinking down on mobile view.

REFLECTION

For the most part, I felt my website came off pretty well.  I have learned a lot of new things this semester and was able to implement those into my project.  Some of the issues I had doing this project were involving creating a live feed in an aside and getting my video to play in full screen mode.  One thing learned, when creating a website, try and get more intune with your target audience and try to cater to their needs.  Getting better at photoshop and design will be a benefit later on when creating websites.
