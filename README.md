REFLECTION

For the most part, I felt my website came off pretty well.  I have learned a lot of new things this semester and was able to implement those into my project.  Some of the issues I had doing this project were involving creating a live feed in an aside and getting my video to play in full screen mode.  One thing learned, when creating a website, try and get more intune with your target audience and try to cater to their needs.  Getting better at photoshop and design will be a benefit later on when creating websites.
